# Simon Game ðŸŽ®

Simon is a game of short-term memory skill invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison. The device creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence. If the user succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and more complex. Once the user fails or the time limit runs out, the game is over.

<strong><h3>âœ… This project's goals are:</h3></strong>
1. Learn how to create a game app (My first one!).
2. Practice timed events with setTimeout and setInterval.
3. Learn how to add audio to an app.
4. Learn how to create code sequences/ patterns.
5. Maybe add a Login and Register so the user can keep track of their score.
6. Learn how to manage state better.

## Features
- Game has 4 colored buttons (Green, Red, Yellow, Blue) they can press.
- Each button will have their own distinct sound.
- When a button is pressed, the button will light up indicating it is active.
- After each successful round, one additional pattern will be added to the sequence.
- If the users enters an incorrect pattern, game will end.
- Pattern should be displayed after a specific interval.
- Display a correct counter.
- Add Login/ Register so the user can keep track of their score.
- Add 2 modes to the Game to make it more complex:
  - Strict mode: restarts the game whenever you select the wrong field in a pattern.
  - Normal mode: repeats the pattern subsequent of the wrong button being pressed.
